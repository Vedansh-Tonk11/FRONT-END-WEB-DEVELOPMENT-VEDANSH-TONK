# Cosmic Microscope - Pure CSS Interactive Simulation

ðŸ”¬ Explore the microscopic universe with this CSS-only interactive microscope!

#ðŸŒŒ Project Overview
The "Cosmic Microscope" is a "100% HTML & CSS & JAVASCRIPT" simulation that mimics a real microscope, allowing users to inspect different microscopic specimens with a cosmic-themed interface. No JavaScriptâ€”just clever CSS techniques for interactivity!  

Perfect for "educational purposes, CSS experiments, or sci-fi-themed projects."
